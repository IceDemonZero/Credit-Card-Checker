# Credit-Card-Checker
This credit card checker is a simple program for checcking whether or not a credit card number is valid. I developed it using Luhn's Algorithm in an attempt to see if I could possibly do it. This checker should work and tell you if a credit card's number is valid. This is a console program so it isn't very flashy.
